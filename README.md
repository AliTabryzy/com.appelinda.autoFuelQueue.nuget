# Maximize the multi-threading performance by balancing the work-load with the use of "Auto Fuel ConcurrentQueue"
Multi-threading can boost the application's performance enormously but making sure that all the threads are receiving an equal 
work-load is a pretty spooky. This article will demonstrate a brand new method of multi-threading's implementation which 
will increase your application's performance to its maximum by distributing "close to equal work-load" between the threads.
